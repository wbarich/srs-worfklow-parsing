Network Administrator and DBA support is also required to maintain a 24x7 system uptime. System security and access levels are provided in the online system. There are varying levels of system access and functional authority. Each student's access is limited to his/her own registration records. Only authorized system administrator(s) has access to all student registration records. The online registration system is ""self-service style"" system that shall initially address the student registration needs."
24,The application should be connected to the Internet. The application should be connected to the GPS device. The application should be easy to extend. The code should be written in a way that it favors implementation of new functions. Test environments should be built for the application to allow testing of the applications different functions. The application should be portable with iOS and Android.

Unauthorised users can only read data without modifying anything. ABS shall handle all expected and unexpected errors in ways that prevent loss in information and long downtime period.
31,Flea Market system will interface with the web server and RDBMS software using APIs provided by the implementation language All transactions at the Flea Market require a valid user ID and password. Secure data transfer over the Internet could be provided using SSL encryption that will be configured by the host system administrator. The IP addresses where the transaction was made from will be logged. User passwords will be stored in the database in an encrypted format. Most of the system functions will be controlled using the administrative interface. Detailed documentation of the code and SRS will enable easy maintenance of the Flea Market.
34,The system use SSL (secured socket layer) in all transactions that include any confidential customer information. The system must automatically log out all customers after a period of inactivity. The system should not leave any cookies on the customer's computer containing the user's password. The system's back-end servers shall only be accessible to authenticated administrators. Sensitive data will be encrypted before being sent over insecure connections like the internet. The system provides storage of all databases on redundant computers with automatic switchover. The reliability of the overall program depends on the reliability of the separate components. The main pillar of reliability of the system is the backup of the database which is continuously maintained and updated to reflect the most recent changes. An end-user may use this system on any OS; either it is Windows or Linux.
35,"The logo and the current basic design of registration system should be displayed. The system should be attractive according to the clients. The design and the color should make users feel comfortable when using the system instead of flashing useless colors on the screen. The design should also reflect the seriousness of the environment. The system should be able to manage all the information incoming from the database and the catalogue. The product is Web based therefore it will be used in any environment that allows Web access. For the system to successfully operate the registration system should be integrated with other IT services and the portal. The system should need to be entirely self-supporting since the users would be using it only to register courses. The Web interface should be compatible with standards in order to be usable via all major Web browsers in a wide variety of environments. Everyone (stakeholders and guests) can have access to the system and the catalogue. Every client must have secure and private access to his/her data. The  and the service man can have access to every part of the system. All these accesses (except the ""guest tour"" access) require identification through ID and password. The system will develop a security system that will reduce to the minimum the possibility of corruption from systems and/or humans."
36,The Operational Interface shall have a Mean Time Between Failures of no less than 7 days. The system shall be available 99.5% of the time. The software system needs a robust security mechanism in place so that unauthorized users are not allowed access to parts of the system. Each user shall either be trusted or not trusted. All source code and development related documents shall be controlled under a version control system. All source code shall adhere to an agreed upon and well-defined set of coding standards for each development language used. Since the software must run on several popular hardware platforms and the goal is to achieve a reasonable level of platform independence.
37,High level of performance requires high speed network and high level of connectivity. The available server must be reliable and the network connectivity in the supermarket should be proper for smooth flow of all operations and data. Every user of the software is provided a unique login ID and a password which is stored in the database hashed by SHA2 algorithm. The software is available for use from the supermarket opening time to the closing time.
40,The system is expected to have reasonable short time response. The voter should be able to login and should be able to get response for his requests in 2-3 seconds. The data transaction between client and server must be encrypted using SSL technology. All the passwords that are generated or accepted must be stored in database in an encrypted form. To prevent attacks the system should generate random word and ask the user to enter it correctly for multiple tryings. The system should warn ECA users about the malfunction of the system. The system should be simple to use

The performance of the website must be optimal incase of huge loads and hence appropriate load balancing must be done to achieve this. There can be any number of mirror servers readily available in case of huge loads without the user getting any delay. The website must provide highest degree of security to the registered users. All the transactions that are made must be secured. The sensitive information passed to and from the website must be secured. Identity theft and other security related issues must be solved.
